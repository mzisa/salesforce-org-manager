## Introduction
**Salesforce Org Manager** is a tool written in C# which provide a GUI to manage Salesforce Apex code projects easily.

The tool is essentially a metadata manager for Salesforce Apex code based projects. 
You can create a new Salesforce Apex project with Salesforce Org Manager or edit an existing Salesforce project metadata.

This tool basically does the same tasks which MavensMate can perform in conjunction with Sublime Text 3 for creating or editing Apex code projects: the main difference is that MavensMate with its Salesforce extension was designed to work with Salesforce "classic" projects, while Salesforce Org Manager is designed mainly for Salesforce DX based project code and its counterpart is **Visual Studio Code** for Apex coding editing instead of Sublime Text 3.

You can use Salesforce Org Manager tool to work with Salesforce sandbox ORGs instead of Salesforce DX ORGs without any issues but you must use Visual Studio Code for coding, using Sublime Text 3 as code editor is not supported

The purpose of this tool is to offer **a comfortable alternative to create and edit Salesforce project metadata** in place of using (only) the command line tool provided by Salesforce DX client tool.
